### About the project:
<p>The project that I created is a "Currency Exchange App" where the user is able to use it to see live currency exchange rates and add family or friends to their portfolio so they can send money to them. All data will be stored in MongoDB and I used an API to gather this live currency data so the user is able to see the exact exchange rate when they send money. To view the application that has been deployed through Heroku, please click --> <a href="http://localhost:3000"> Currency Exchange App </a></p>
